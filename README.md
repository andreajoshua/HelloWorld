## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Image was initially appearing in preview, but not within the app - looked up how to fix it and why it wasn't working, required changing
just one line of code. Github was also not authenticated with correct username and password, used another method to share the project
which was generating a personal access token and using that to authenticate instead.
